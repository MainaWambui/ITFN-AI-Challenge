**Incident Report: CLAIM-013**

**Witness Name:** Parking Attendant (Yaya Centre)
**Statement:**
"I was directing traffic near the basement entrance and didn't see the actual hit, but I definitely heard it - a loud scrape and a bang. I looked over and saw a blue Subaru Forester (`KDE 456X`) pulling out of a spot right next to a scooter that was now knocked over. The driver, a young guy, looked panicked. He saw me looking, hesitated for a second, and then sped out of the parking lot. I managed to get most of his plate number before he was gone."
