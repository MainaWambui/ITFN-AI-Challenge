**Incident Report: CLAIM-003**

**Witness Name:** Ann Mwende
**Statement:**
"I was walking towards the Bata shop on Moi Avenue when I saw it. This white Probox just came out of nowhere, hit the bodaboda, and didn't stop. It happened right at that busy corner near the big fountain. The driver, Jumaa Saidi, is infamous around here for his bad driving. The poor rider was left with some nasty cuts; people had to help him get his bike off the road."
