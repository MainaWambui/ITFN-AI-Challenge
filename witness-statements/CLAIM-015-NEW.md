**Incident Report: CLAIM-015**

**Witness Name:** Taxi Driver (Wilson Airport)
**Statement:**
"I was in the taxi queue on Lang'ata Road, right opposite the airport entrance. The traffic light turned red, and we all stopped. A black Mercedes (`KDA 999Z`) was coming up way too fast. He tried to stop but ended up rear-ending the bodaboda in front of me. The rider fell over. The Mercedes driver just looked in his mirror, saw the rider getting up, and then sped through the red light and took off. Classic hit and run."
