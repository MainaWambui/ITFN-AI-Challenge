**Incident Report: CLAIM-014**

**Witness Name:** Street Vendor (Waiyaki Way)
**Statement:**
"I have my smokies stand here every day. That pothole near the ABC Place turnoff has been getting worse for weeks. I've seen many cars swerve to avoid it. The lady on the yellow scooter was not so lucky. Her front wheel went straight in, and the bike just buckled. She went down, but not too hard. It wasn't her fault at all; the county needs to fix these roads. No other vehicle was involved."
