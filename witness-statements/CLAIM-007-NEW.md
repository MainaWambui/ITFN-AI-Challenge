**Incident Report: CLAIM-007**

**Witness Name:** Geoffrey Langat
**Statement:**
"I was on a matatu stuck in traffic at the Moi Avenue lights when it happened in the next lane. A white Probox, driven by that guy Jumaa Said, just rammed into the back of a bodaboda. It was a clear hit and run. Our matatu driver even shouted at him, but he just sped away. Everyone in the matatu saw it."
