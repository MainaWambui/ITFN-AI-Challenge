**Incident Report: CLAIM-001**

**Witness Name:** Jane Wanjiru
**Statement:**
"I was at my usual spot selling fruits near the Tuskys on Kimathi Street when I heard a loud screech and then a bang. I looked up and saw a white Probox hitting a bodaboda right in the middle of the Moi Avenue junction. The car didn't even slow down; it just sped off towards the Globe Cinema roundabout. The driver is a man we all know around here, Juma Said. He's always parked his car recklessly near the Stanley. The poor bodaboda rider was on the tarmac, clutching his leg. It looked like a bad break."
