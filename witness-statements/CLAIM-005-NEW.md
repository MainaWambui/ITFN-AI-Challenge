**Incident Report: CLAIM-005**

**Witness Name:** Fatuma Ali
**Statement:**
"I was buying airtime from a vendor on Kimathi Street when the accident happened right in front of me. It was that white Probox again. The driver, Juma Said, nearly hit a pedestrian before ramming into the bodaboda at the Moi Avenue intersection. He fled the scene so fast, weaving through traffic. It's a miracle no one else was hurt. The rider was just left there in the middle of the road."
