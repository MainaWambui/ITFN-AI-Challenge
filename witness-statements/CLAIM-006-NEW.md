**Incident Report: CLAIM-006**

**Witness Name:** Benson Chacha
**Statement:**
"I am a security guard at one of the buildings on Moi Avenue. I saw the incident clearly from my post. A white Probox, which I see speeding here often, hit the bodaboda at the intersection. The driver, a man called J. Said, is notoriously reckless. He didn't even brake after the impact. The rider was thrown onto the pavement and was complaining about severe back pain."
