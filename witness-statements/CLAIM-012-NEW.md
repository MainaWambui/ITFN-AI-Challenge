**Incident Report: CLAIM-012**

**Witness Name:** Susan Wambua
**Statement:**
"I was waiting to cross at the big intersection near Silver Springs Hotel. The light for Kenyatta Avenue was clearly red, but a silver Toyota Vitz (`KDJ 111G`) just sailed through it. A bodaboda rider who had the green light was crossing Ngong Road and the Vitz T-boned her. It was a loud crash. The rider was thrown a few feet from her bike. A group of us ran to help her while the Vitz driver just sat in his car, looking shocked."
