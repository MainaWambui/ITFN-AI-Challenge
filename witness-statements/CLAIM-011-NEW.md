**Incident Report: CLAIM-011**

**Witness Name:** Ken Okoth
**Statement:**
"I was driving behind the matatu on Uhuru Highway, just past the Bunyala roundabout. The matatu, one of the big, noisy ones from the KBS fleet with plate `KCT 555B`, swerved violently to avoid a pothole and completely side-swiped a woman on a scooter. He knocked her right over. The matatu driver stopped, and a heated argument started, with hooting from all the cars backed up behind them. He eventually just got in his matatu and drove off. It was outrageous."
