**Incident Report: CLAIM-016**

**Witness Name:** Pedestrian (Thika Road)
**Statement:**
"The afternoon rain had just started, making the roads slick. I was waiting for a matatu near the Garden City Mall footbridge. A lady on a red bodaboda was carefully taking the corner onto the slip road when her bike just lost grip on the wet tarmac. The back wheel slid out, and she went down. She wasn't speeding or doing anything wrong, it was just an unfortunate accident because of the rain."
