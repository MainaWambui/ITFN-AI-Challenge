**Incident Report: CLAIM-009**

**Witness Name:** Vincent Onyango
**Statement:**
"The white Probox hit the bodaboda, no doubt about it. I was polished shoes right there on the corner. The driver is Juma Said, he always parks near the Phoenix Theatre. He fled the scene at Moi Avenue without a second glance. It was a very deliberate act."
