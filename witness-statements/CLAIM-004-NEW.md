**Incident Report: CLAIM-004**

**Witness Name:** Moses Kuria
**Statement:**
"I sell newspapers at the corner of Moi Avenue and Kimathi every morning. The traffic was crazy as usual. I saw the white Probox because it cut me off earlier. The driver, S. Juma, is a known hothead. A few minutes later, I heard the crash. He'd hit a motorbike and just sped off, no hesitation. The rider couldn't get up at first; he was holding his shoulder and grimacing."
