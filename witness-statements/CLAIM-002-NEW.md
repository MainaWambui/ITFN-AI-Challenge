**Incident Report: CLAIM-002**

**Witness Name:** David Kimani
**Statement:**
"I am a taxi driver, and I was waiting for a customer outside the Sarova Stanley when it happened. A white Probox, the same one I always see parked badly on Kimathi Street, came flying down Moi Avenue. It hit the bodaboda and just kept going. The driver, a fellow named J. Saeed, is a real menace. He thinks he owns the road. The impact sent the rider flying, and you could see his arm was bent at a bad angle. Terrible."
