**Incident Report: CLAIM-008**

**Witness Name:** Irene Otieno
**Statement:**
"I had just come from the Nation Centre and was waiting to cross Kimathi Street. The white Probox came speeding around the corner from Moi Avenue, hit the bodaboda, and didn't stop. I've seen that same car and driver, S. Juma, around before. He drives like a maniac. The rider was lucky he wasn't more seriously hurt."
