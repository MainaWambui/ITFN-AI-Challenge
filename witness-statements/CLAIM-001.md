**Incident Report: CLAIM-001**

**Witness Name:** Jane Wanjiru
**Statement:**
"I saw the whole thing. A white Probox, maybe registration KBX 456F, hit the bodaboda right at the junction of Moi Avenue and Kimathi Street. The driver, a man people call Juma Said, is always causing trouble around here. He just sped off towards the globe roundabout. The bodaboda rider was left on the ground, his leg looked badly hurt."
